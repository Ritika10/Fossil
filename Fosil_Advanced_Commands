Purge :
  ** Moves the data into the graveyard
  - fossil purge files {names}
    - Can even be used for directories
  - fossil purge list
  - fossil purge obliterate
  - fossil purge checkins [tags]
  - fossil purge undo ID : Recoved that particular ID of the purge
  - fossil obliterate ID : Complete remove that purge, be careful

  ** My Comments
    - Need to clean up the files manually as well
    - Purging happens only in local clone copy and never syncs back. Need to copy back the clone to central repo
    - "fossil rebuild --vacuum" if any commit failures
